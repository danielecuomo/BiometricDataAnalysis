# MultiBiometricDataAnalysis
A technology for storing and analyzing multi-biometric data

I made this project during my bachelor studies at Universit√† Federico II di Napoli.

## Abstract
Modern society sees a constant evolution of technologies for the recognition of people through biometrics. The efficiency of the biometric systems is a topic of critical interest, given the importance that the accuracy obtained can have. Just think of a security system that requires authentication procedures capable of effectively avoiding false positives and negatives.
In this context we face problems due to the variability of the traits that distinguish a person. Multi-biometric systems offer a solution that provides for the integration of multiple biometric information sources. With the combination of different data, in fact, the recognition will be less susceptible to the mistake made by the individual.
The topic dealt with in this thesis is precisely multibiometry, with particular attention to the design of a data storage system, a fundamental element in such an environment.
